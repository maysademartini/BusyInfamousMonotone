Join her quest to find a way home and help her take revenge on the evil witch that tore her away from her lands. Discover a world filled with political intrigue as a power-hungry Emperor seeks to wrestle control of the Twelve Duchies by use of his magical Affinity Guards , and get caught up in a rebellion where Sophia's abilities will help decide the fate of the strange, monster-filled world into which she's been swept. Venture with her into steampunk, technomage lairs abandoned since the mythical 'Age of Words'. Share her descent into The Purple, a strange and disturbing underworld where everything lusts for flesh. Help her explore a dark forests under the curse of an Evil Blight and discover the reasons behind it. Help her make new friends in a dangerous world, and share in her first unlikely, romance. Aid her in her discovery of an ancient, magical curse that lies over the world, denying all it's inhabitants the ability to read.

About: â€˜Unhappy Ever Afterâ€™ is a dark, yet funny, RPG that takes traditional fairy tales and turns them on their heads. Along your journey you will meet familiar characters that youâ€™ve know all your life and see them in new situations and within frameworks that you will make you both laugh and despair. Beyond its parody to the fantasy, â€˜Unhappy Ever Afterâ€™ also aims to parody the real, drawing on situations that are all too pervasive in our world, such as drug abuse, terrorism, and dirty politics. Death too is a prevalent theme and no character, no matter how well known, how famous, or how integral to the plot, is safe from its cold hand! Despite its beautiful graphics, wondrous music, and humorous interludes, â€˜Unhappy Ever Afterâ€™ is a game, in places, designed to shock and appal, and where your decisions, no matter how noble can lead to devastating ends. Features: * Explore a free-roam world where you decide who to help and who to leave to their own fate. * Meet characters from ancient stories and rhymes such as Hansel and Gretel,or Little Red Riding Hood. * A unique magic system where strengthening one ability weakens another. * An addictive drug system, complete with dealers and quests. * An adult-themed RPG with political coups, terrorism, drugs, murder, and revenge. * Beautiful lands to explore. * A coming of age story with meaningful character progression. * Team up with interesting and powerful companions each with their own story, conversations, and personalities! * A day and night system where characters go to bed and monsters come out at night. * 14 hour story-line with many extra side quests, plus another 2 hour free bonus DLC 'The Maze of Cefgellin' * Play on after the story's end, doing quests, and building up your character and base camp. * Controller support, Mouse and Keyboard - full keybinding.","['English']","[]","â€œUnhappy Ever After is the result of a wicked mindâ€™s imagination!â€ 8/10 â€“ OPN","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/header.jpg?t=1490429559","","http://warpedtales.weebly.com/","the.warped.tales@gmail.com",True,True,True,0,"",0,16,10,"",0,0,"",218,0,218,0,"Warped Tales","Warped Tales","Single-player,Steam Trading Cards,Partial Controller Support","Adventure,Indie,RPG","Adventure,Indie,RPG,RPGMaker,Dark Fantasy,Fantasy,Magic,Dark Comedy","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_2633a000f0c52ddd4aaa4f6ba6f92315b72c6b32.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_97f13cdc8e0f2efac222d00dcad65c2f9f786a92.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_845b2a32cc31afa264587e4bff3dfcb47780a7eb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_c643f2814b34930b2faae562237dd1336822c024.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_1aaae69f2399d3df81056fcfa3ce28dcbff249ae.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_22f70f34e4a7e39fdb2aa9841748cc7bbb18ac7d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_453a0e5bc82e5401a1742d7a955d5a1832a5d7b1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_10a74a79352a5e13607fa2b7c732186d1c67d6e3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_c81c5b477bc32a9ba0893a796bc7a5ba89ea0633.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_47190db23d847f648333e806eeddb925a1b0f4c9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_65944ebf80f21df256b8f18b60a1c38deacff9a5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_89840d572dbe7c7bb22c7796b0d511c75aaf0fe1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_88d55d2249385460a434e802c4f73568dbeca5f0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_577784115f5550de311960100799a53cbf92a9de.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_4faf9305ca187c787f315a3e1764181cdbfa5a38.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_769552b5a36e2d56f3ccb013b155373c0e17f8ad.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_397be0fa648f76db83662d886f07c4f3de9d679c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_31aa64d32fa7b10b7f94ab51408210825056c842.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_0a8a52501655c6e2869376868bc5c7bd7ebc8046.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256677348/movie_max.mp4?t=1483567252"

Become an adventurer, hunt for treasures, explore unknown regions of the world and rescue the damsel in distress from the clutches of enemies, both earthly and not-so-earthly. Join James Lee Quatermain on his journey across the globe! The Story The year is 1938. James Lee Quatermain is a man of many talents, yet holding on to money isn't one of them. James is an adventurer by trade, just like his legendary great-grandfather Allan Quatermain. And he knows how to squeeze money out of this famous name of his, while at the same time despising it. Despising those who believe his great-grandfather's tales of the supernatural and those who make fun of them alike. Accordingly, Quatermain isn't all too keen on escorting Jennifer Goodwin, an US agent and former colleague of his, to an Egyptian temple structure in order to retrieve an ancient artifact - The Heart of Atlantis. Neither does he believe in the reputed invigorating qualities of this artifact, nor does he care the least that a division of the Ahnenerbe, the Nazi department specialized in the occult, is after The Heart as well. But life has its ways of changing one's perspective. Quatermain soon finds himself part of a hunt across the globe - from the stormy deserts of Egypt to the icy depths of the Arctic, and all the way to the steaming jungles of Guatemala. In long forgotten temple structures the thrill of the chase awakens the true adventurer in Quatermain, as he and agent Goodwin strive to be one step ahead of the Nazis and the Russians, one step closer to obtaining the Heart of Atlantis. And deep in these temples, where age-old guardians awake from their eternal slumber, James soon learns that his great-grandfather's stories are not as crazy as he had always believed. For all things live forever, though at times they sleep and are forgotten... Key Features Action -Adventure gameplay from a first-person perspective Set in the Quatermain-universe, created by H. R. Haggard Fast-paced action and intense, accurate FPS gun battles Adventurer equipment: compass, treasure maps, notebook and flashlight â€“ necessary to solve ancient puzzles, find treasures and even to defeat certain types of enemies Puzzles that encourage you to explore the game environment and interact with it Environmental traps that can be used to eliminate enemies in many spectacular ways Exotic, picturesque locations from around the world â€“ Egypt, Arctic and forgotten Mayan ruins in the jungles of Guatemala Compelling story faithful to the spirit of classic action-adventure movies 1930â€™s setting, including detailed weapon designs Unique adventurer-style multiplayer features and modes","['English', 'German', 'Polish', 'French', 'Russian']","['English', 'German', 'Russian']","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/header.jpg?t=1561964976","http://www.deadfall-game.com/","","support@quanticlab.com",True,False,True,53,"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/deadfall-adventures?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f",0,1716,628,"",50,1140,"",324,0,431,0,"The Farm 51","THQ Nordic","Single-player,Multi-player,Co-op,Steam Achievements,Steam Trading Cards,Partial Controller Support,Steam Cloud,Steam Leaderboards","Action,Adventure","Adventure,Action,FPS,Shooter,Multiplayer,First-Person,Singleplayer,Puzzle,Zombies,Co-op,Indie,Horror,Survival,Exploration,Open World,Action-Adventure,World War II,Strategy","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_e53512c37c3b4927efec4ef2dccec62084af5a57.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_e5660e00480523bab71e5758c6606de0abf9bebf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_eb71d7cb42e05f68b50d14a3d2a8bd60145acb98.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_6ce7d35e3e24b9f5d35d8ebb27a0ca793ad08361.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_8b3791b17d55df0461262b23192a725f80de2593.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_d30c427a0ce9d8b04ca0809ae71f5356e0204e73.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_3109f03c94c404b51e5775ad86a60e81e132ad19.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_0ae6376d1947a3907690ed0a725e81d589cf5760.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_d4e66c6d44b80b5835acabad30cb60292267e922.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_ccc8d733e5f5e565ceaa4be6d8edcf6bdab95079.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_b6ef227c36746b589e96d57eb3b09fba2d2c1cc6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_18bb9893a8c153b743417f8ada5526d7e172170b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_5b3342439c4a7fcb93ab253be906817f849da3e7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_6338aab220eabdf66b1137d0ad71278b255ce39f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_8292d4dd3ea71a927d2b8b09c41a4856e72b59fd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_27bd5bdb26ed53217bf31d013e795d0d5376e880.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_aac2586e6d2a200f246c11f399216576bad38dc1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_aac19564f29ac14d3b70f1bbae5d6233284530cc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_763fee337f9ec69f6c6724460264e7c92d09c1ba.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_f70a0c7cc773129ef12bd9ebcaf9bfcba74c637c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029553/movie_max.mp4?t=1490862566,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2030185/movie_max.mp4?t=1490862575,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2028438/movie_max.mp4?t=1490862584,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2030143/movie_max.mp4?t=1493809128,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2030092/movie_max.mp4?t=1493809135"

Now four thawed-out crewmembers are the only hope for two million passengers seeking life on a new world. In an effort to save humanity from an earth-shattering asteroid, an ARK Mothership was built to transport two million frozen souls safely to a new, habitable world. At least, that was the plan. Midway through its long journey, the ARK Mothership computers discovered that it was far off course and low on fuel. With no other options, four passengers were awoken early. Their job? To crew the â€œOddysseyâ€ resource vessel, mine asteroids for resources and help the Mother Ship reach the next source of fuel. The process is slow, and more crew members may need to be awoken, but the fates of 1,999,996 fellow passengers hang in the balance. Itâ€™s up to you and your crew to Build, Explore, and Manage your team to get enough resources for the next big jump to a habitable planetary system. The future of humanity literally depends on it! Collect resources by mining nearby asteroids. Use the collected material to create new tools and technology or send back to the ARK as fuel. A good crew works effectively. While one is building a new science station, another can be mining asteroids or improving the ship. Crewmembers can gain temporary boosts and debuffs while working. Ignoring a negative status can impact your performance and eventually lead to grave consequences. Discover lost alien technology and study it to improve your own. Use resources to repair and expand your ship and upgrade its technology. Defend it from alien creatures, solar flares and dangerous asteroids. Every crew member is an integral part of your crew. Unless they die, then they are preplaced with one of the 1.9 million other potential crew members. Each crew member comes equipped with a unique set of skills.
